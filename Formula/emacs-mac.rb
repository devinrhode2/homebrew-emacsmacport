      This is YAMAMOTO Mitsuharu's experimental "Mac port" addition to
      GNU Emacs 24. This provides a native GUI support for Mac OS X
      10.4 - 10.10. After installing, see README-mac and NEWS-mac
      in #{prefix} for the port details.

      Emacs.app was installed to:
        #{prefix}

      To link the application to default Homebrew App location:
        brew linkapps
      or:
        ln -s #{prefix}/Emacs.app /Applications

      For a CLI starter, please look at:
        https://gist.github.com/4043945

      This Emacs Mac Port is best used outside the terminal to take
      advantage of buffer swiping and smooth scrolling.

      For more tips, like creating an Emacs.app that starts in your projects
      directory instead of root, see http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS#toc22

      To install info files under share/info, an environment variable
      need been set before install. Read more: man brew.
        export HOMEBREW_KEEP_INFO=1

  # Follow Homebrew and don't install ctags from Emacs. This allows Vim
  # and Emacs and exuberant ctags to play together without violence.
